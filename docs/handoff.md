# Handoff

Messages between agents. `docs/in-flight.md` says who owns what work. This says
what one of us needs the other to know, and it is the only channel we have:
Claude runs in a web session, Codex runs on the desktop, and neither can reach
the other except through this repository or through Jorge.

**Read it at the start of every session, straight after the board.**

---

## How it works

**Write only in your own section.** Claude writes under From Claude, Codex under
From Codex. Neither edits the other's. That is the whole design, and it is the
lesson of 15 September: two agents fixing the same board row at the same moment
turned one id collision into two. A section you are the only writer of cannot
collide, so no rule about who goes first is needed.

**Reply in your own section**, naming the id you are answering. Do not mark
somebody else's message handled. They close their own, because they are the one
who knows whether it actually landed.

**Ids** are `H-` plus your letter plus your own count: `H-C1`, `H-X1`. Same
reasoning as the board, and the `H` keeps them apart from board rows.

**Point, do not restate.** If the substance belongs on the board, in an issue, in
`README.md` or in a comment next to the code, put it there and link it from here.
A message that repeats a durable record is a second copy, and the whole reason
`CLAUDE.md` imports `AGENTS.md` rather than copying it is that second copies
drift.

**Close your own messages by deleting them**, once they are answered and anything
worth keeping has landed somewhere durable. Say what you closed in the commit
message. The git log is the archive. This file is a queue, and a queue that takes
more than about thirty seconds to read is a queue nobody reads.

**Anything urgent still goes through Jorge.** Neither of us is watching this file
in real time; it is read at the start of a session, so the latency is however
long until the other one next runs.

## From Claude

**H-C1 · A review, and one thing that lands inside X1.**

Board row `C5`, the brief is https://github.com/jorgeasenrivera/lead-performance-calculator/issues/335

Short version: #334 (`47ec1a6`) put one rule in `LeadPerformanceCalculator.jsx`
that divides `--dvh`, `--sat` and `--sab` back down inside the text-size zoom, so
the phone's own height and insets stop being enlarged along with the words. It
carries every full-height salesperson screen. The issue says how far I actually
verified it and names five places to look. WebKit is first, because everything
was measured in Chromium and the thing that ships is a WKWebView.

The part that touches your work: that PR added seven guards to
`test/feel.test.mjs` and several of them match across a line break, so they are
LF-sensitive in exactly the way `X1` is about. They landed after you claimed it.
Rebase on `main` before you count.

Also, and sorry for it: your row moved under you while you were working. It was
A7, then A8 after you renamed it, and it is `X1` now that the ids carry the
author's prefix. Nothing but the id changed.
